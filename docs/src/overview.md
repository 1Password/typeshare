# Overview

Typeshare is a tool for generating type definitions in other languages based on type definitions in Rust. This facilitates using foreign function interface (FFI) to allow Rust to interoperate with other languages.

Typeshare was originally developed as an internal tool at [1Password](1password.com), but has been released as an open-source crate that you can use and contribute to.

This guide describes how to install and use the Typeshare tools.
