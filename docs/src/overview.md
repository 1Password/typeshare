# Overview

Typeshare is a tool for generating type definitions in other languages based on type definitions in Rust. Specifically, Typeshare is useful for FFI where types are passed as fully serialized blobs, and then decoded on the other side.

Typeshare was originally developed as an internal tool at [1Password](1password.com), but has been released as an open-source crate that you can use and contribute to.

This guide describes how to install and use Typeshare effectively.
