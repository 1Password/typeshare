# Contributing to Typeshare

Thank you! If you would like to contribute to the project, go to [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/1Password/typeshare). There, you can open issues to report bugs and request features.

If you want to contribute code, please send a [GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/1Password/typeshare/pull/new/master) to the repository with a clear list of your changes and the reasons for the changes. Before contributing, you should probably familiarize yourself with the internal documentation, if you haven't already. Make sure to look through the READMEs for each part of Typeshare you plan to contribute to, and double-check the Rust documentation on `docs.rs` if you want to know more about the API. And feel free to open an issue if you want to ask the 1Password team directly, or if the documentation is unclear.

For larger changes, please open an RFC issue first in order to discuss the broader impacts of the proposed change with the other maintainers.
