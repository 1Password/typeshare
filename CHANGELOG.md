# Version 1.1.0

This release brings major new additions, the largest of which is support for Scala as a language generation target. 
Additionally, the code generation API has been expanded/revised, and many bugs have been fixed.

* `typeshare-cli`
  * Kotlin now uses `val` consistently for defining fields.
  * Some issues with the command line options have been corrected.
  * Unit structs that don't use bracket syntax are now supported.
  * Typescript can now handle type aliases of optional types.
  * Empty structs are now represented as objects in Kotlin.
  * You can now define read-only Typescript properties with `#[typeshare(typescript(readonly))]`.
  * Doubly-nested option types (`Option<Option<T>>`) are now supported in Typescript.

* `typeshare-core`
  * The `Language` trait now takes `self` mutably for more flexibility in implementations.
  * Scala is now a supported language for code generation, though the CLI does not use it yet.
  * The attribute parser has been reworked to be more robust and flexible for future additions.

* Miscellaneous
  * We now have a proper release system and prebuilt binaries for anyone to download ðŸŽ‰
  * Releases will be weekly on every Thursday.
