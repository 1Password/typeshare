# CI that:
#
# * checks for a Git Tag that looks like a release ("v1.2.0")
# * creates a Github Release™️
# * builds binaries/packages with cargo-dist
# * uploads those packages to the Github Release™️
#
# Note that the Github Release™️ will be created before the packages,
# so there will be a few minutes where the release has no packages
# and then they will slowly trickle in, possibly failing. To make
# this more pleasant we mark the release as a "draft" until all
# artifacts have been successfully uploaded. This allows you to
# choose what to do with partial successes and avoids spamming
# anyone with notifications before the release is actually ready.

# This task will run whenever you push a git tag that looks like
# a version number. We just look for `v` followed by at least one number
# and then whatever. so `v1`, `v1.0.0`, and `v1.0.0-prerelease` all work.
#
# If there's a prerelease-style suffix to the version then the Github Release™️
# will be marked as a prerelease (handled by taiki-e/create-gh-release-action).
#
# Note that when generating links to uploaded artifacts, cargo-dist will currently
# assume that your git tag is always v{VERSION} where VERSION is the version in
# the published package's Cargo.toml (this is the default behaviour of cargo-release).
# In the future this may be made more robust/configurable.
